1.How would you describe acessibility on the web to someone new to programming?

The term 'accessibility' refers to the design of services or products within the 
technological environment that caters to individuals with disabilities.  

2.Talk about 3 different things you can do to ensure your website is accessible.

    1. Be sure to make the website keyboard friendly for others.
    Example - Making the tab key as a means to navigate the website.

    2. Be sure to make the content accessibile or easy to find for everyone.

    3. Be to add ALT text to all images.

    4. Be sure to select proper colors for individuals who may be colorblind.

3.How would you explain the concept of a variable to someone new to programming?

Colloquially, I will describe a variable as an empty box/container. As a empty has nothing
of value within it, so it can be seen as being undefined. If one were to place a number or a string. 
Then that variable can be declared to whatever number or string that is in it.
For example: let myNumber = 10; 

4.What is the purpose of using functions in code?

    A function is a subprogram mainly design to perform or execute a particular
    task. A function becomes active when they are invoke or called. Values can be passed
    into functions or used within a function. In other words, a fucntion is a set of 
    task or code that can be utilized multiple times, which helps to make the code
    for other developers readible by reducing redundant code.
